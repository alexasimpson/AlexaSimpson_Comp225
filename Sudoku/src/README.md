It took me quite a while to get the files pushed to the repository. 
But I will say for now that I followed the book, "Hello, Android" closely
up until PuzzleView, where the author steps away from xml files and starts
using straight Java code. I decided to stop there for now, since I was understanding
less and less once the PuzzleView class continued. Instead, I tried to
test what I had learned using the xml files to create another class and layout
(GameVisual.java and puzzle.xml), so that a non-interactive grid
appears when the "New Game" button is pressed. By consulting the files already 
created and exploring the various layout options and formats, I was successful
in doing this. The correct onClick() result for new_game in the Sudoku class is
commented out, so that an "example game" will appear when New Game is clicked.

I did not include many comments, and will be sure to add those in before continuing
my exploration into Android. 

My experience with Android coding thus far is that, as you mentioned,
it is much easier to refer to xml files than it is to code straight in
Java.  I can imagine the onCreate() methods being much longer and more
difficult to understand using only Java code.

So far I have completed the following steps, following the book:
- Created and edited several layouts (in landscape mode as well)
- Getting a better understanding of their features (Buttons, Tables et)
- Created new values (arrays, menus, etc)
- Created new Activities (About, GameVisual etc.)
- Added required information to the Manifest and "Main Activity" Class
- Defined methods to carry these Activities out
